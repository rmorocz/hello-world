# hello-world
New to Git and GitHub. Creating first repository.

I have been coding in C++ and MATLAB for a while, but recently I decided to learn Unity and C# for game development and to create educational experiences. Currently, I have been working on a 2D endless runner featuring a flying pig named Goat and multiple VR experiences thanks to Udacity's VR Development Nanodegree (fantastic course!). 

My hope now is to learn how to use Git and GitHub to be able to work collaboratively with some of my friends and hopefully with anyone else that wants to participate. Eventually I would like to develop educational experiences taking full advantage of the power of VR and AR.
